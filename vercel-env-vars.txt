VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES - SECURITY GUIDE:

==== PUBLIC VARIABLES (Safe for client-side) ====
These use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix and are exposed to browsers:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_stripe_publishable_key_here

Note: Firebase keys are designed to be public (secured by Firebase Security Rules)
Note: Google Maps key must be public for browser usage (secured by HTTP referrer restrictions)
Note: Stripe publishable key is safe for client-side (designed to be public)

==== PRIVATE VARIABLES (Server-side only) ====
⚠️ NEVER add NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix to these:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
1. Gemini API key is now used ONLY in API routes (server-side)
2. All AI calls go through /api/ai/* endpoints
3. Never expose GEMINI_API_KEY to client code
4. Set HTTP referrer restrictions for Google Maps API in Google Cloud Console
5. Stripe secret key is used ONLY in API routes for payment processing
6. Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard before deployment

1. Set all above environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Push changes to master branch (auto-deploys)
3. Or run: npm run deploy (manual deployment)
4. Verify deployment at: https://your-app.vercel.app
